                    <span>
                        In your account settings, locate the "Add Server" option. Here, you can link various Mastodon server 
                        instances to amalgamate your feeds. Enter the server instance details, such as mastodon.social or mastodon.world, 
                        and follow the on-screen instructions.

                        For each Mastodon server instance you add, you'll need to complete the OAuth procedure. 
                        This is a secure authentication process that establishes a connection between Feed Amalgamator 
                        and your Mastodon accounts. Don't worry; we've streamlined the process to make it as seamless as possible.

                    <span>
                        Once you've added and authenticated your Mastodon server instances, head to the Feed Amalgamator homepage. 
                        Here, you'll find your newly created amalgamated feedâ€” a single, centralized stream that combines all your Mastodon accounts.
